# rock_paper_scissors


This project is the Rock Paper Scissors game built as part of The Odin Project’s Foundations curriculum.  

It started as a console-based program and was later enhanced with a mobile-first graphical interface using a branching workflow introduced in the "Revisiting Rock Paper Scissors" lesson.

## Features
- Randomized computer choices  
- User input via prompt() and console output  
- Functions to handle game logic and score tracking  

## Tech Stack
- JavaScript (vanilla)  
- HTML  
- CSS  

## Extra Features
- Mobile-first design for mobile, tablet, and desktop responsiveness  
- Unlimited play instead of fixed rounds  
- Graphical interface with buttons for player input  
- Live score display and in-page result updates  
- Reset score functionality for new game sessions  
- Local saving of scores using JSON and localStorage  
- Visual feedback: green flash for a win, red flash for a loss  
- Git branching workflow: developed the UI in a feature branch and rebased into main
